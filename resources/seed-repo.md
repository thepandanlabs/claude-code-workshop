# The Seed Repository

The seed is the starting point for the workshop's build block. Everyone clones the workshop repo and navigates into the `seed/` subfolder — no separate repo to clone.

## What's in it

```

```

## How to get it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thepandanlabs/claude-code-workshop.git
cd claude-code-workshop/seed
```

## How to confirm it's healthy

After cloning, run:

```bash
# Install dependencies (uv if you have it, pip otherwise)
uv sync                          # OR: pip install -e .

# Confirm the test harness loads (everything will fail — that's expected)
pytest tests/ --collect-only

# Confirm Claude Code can see the slash commands
claude /prime
```

If `pytest --collect-only` lists three tests and `/prime` reads the PRD back to you, you're ready.

## What's deliberately not in it

- **Working source files.** `src/receipts/*.py` are stubs. The whole point of the workshop is that Claude Code fills them in based on the PRD and `CLAUDE.md`.
- **A `.env` file.** Claude Code uses your authenticated session — no API key juggling.
- **Auth, persistence beyond SQLite, anything cloud.** The PRD explicitly puts these out of scope.

## Why the tests ship pre-built

Because the workshop's central beat is *watching a test fail and then pass*. If attendees write the tests themselves, the harness shows up at 01:35 instead of 01:25, and the verification block runs out of time. Pre-built tests + empty source files = the right balance.

The golden CSV (`tests/golden/may.csv`) is intentionally one row short of what the ten samples should produce. The first run of `pytest` will fail. That failure is the teaching moment of Block 4.
